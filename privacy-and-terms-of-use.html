    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
    ArgrynGuard is an experimental identity verification utility designed for high-risk environments.
    It is strictly a verification tool to protect against impersonation and deepfakes;
    it is <strong>not</strong> a secure messaging or communication platform.
</p>

<h3>1. Required Permissions</h3>

<h4>Camera Access</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Purpose:</strong> Required to scan QR codes for the 'Ephemeral Handshake' (Identity Exchange).
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Images are processed in Random Access Memory (RAM) for QR detection and immediately discarded.</li>
    <li><strong>No Persistence:</strong> No video or photos are ever saved to storage or transmitted.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Biometrics (FaceID / Fingerprint)</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Purpose:</strong> Required to unlock the hardware-backed encryption keys (Secure Enclave) that protect your database.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The app never accesses your actual biometric data. We only receive a cryptographic 'token' from the operating system upon successful verification.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Data Processing & Storage</h3>

<h4>Contact Metadata (Names/Photos)</h4>
<p>
    Stored locally in an encrypted SQLite database (AES-256). This data is used solely to display your personal directory of verified contacts.
</p>

<h4>Cryptographic Secrets (Keys)</h4>
<p>
    Master keys are wrapped by the device's Secure Enclave. Session keys are derived temporarily in RAM.
</p>

<h4>No Backup Possibility</h4>
<p>
    <strong>Intentional Limitation:</strong> To the best of our knowledge, there is no mechanism to back up, export, or transfer this data to another device. This restriction is a deliberate security feature designed to neutralize sophisticated cloning and offline brute-force attacks.
</p>

<h4>Network & Cloud</h4>
<p>
    ArgrynGuard operates on an <strong>'Offline-First'</strong> architecture. We have no servers, no trackers, and no analytics. No data is ever transmitted off the device by the app.

    <div style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.4; color: #1a1a1a;">
        <strong>Zero-Knowledge Architecture:</strong> We cannot recover your account or access your data, even under court order, because we do not hold the keys.

<h2>Usage Agreement</h2>

<p style="color: #666;">Please read carefully before proceeding.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>1. Purpose & Scope</strong><br>
        ArgrynGuard is a free, experimental civilian tool intended to help individuals verify identity and reduce impersonation risks (such as deepfakes or AI voice/video cloning).<br><br>
        It is not a secure messaging platform, not a forensic or law-enforcement tool, and not intended for military, intelligence, surveillance, or criminal use.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>2. Experimental Software Notice</strong><br>
        This application is experimental and provided for testing and evaluation purposes only. It may contain bugs, design limitations, or security weaknesses. You should not rely on this app as your sole method of identity verification or security.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>3. Data Permanence & Irreversible Loss</strong><br>
        ArgrynGuard does not use cloud backups, account recovery, or key duplication.<br><br>
        If you lose your device, forget your PIN, or trigger a security wipe, all data is permanently destroyed and cannot be recovered.<br><br>
        For security reasons, <strong>10 consecutive failed PIN attempts</strong> will automatically and irreversibly destroy all cryptographic keys stored on the device.<br><br>
        By continuing, you acknowledge that you understand and accept this risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>4. User Responsibility</strong><br>
        You are solely responsible for:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Safeguarding your device and PIN.</li>
            <li>Understanding the app’s limitations.</li>
            <li>Any data loss, lockout, or unintended wipe.</li>
        </ul>
        The developer cannot restore data or bypass security mechanisms under any circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>5. Ethical & Lawful Use</strong><br>
        This software is intended for defensive, ethical, and lawful use only, such as protecting personal identity and privacy.<br><br>
        The developer does not support or authorize the use of this app for harassment, deception, surveillance, coercion, illegal activity, or harm to others.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>6. No Warranty (“AS IS”)</strong><br>
        This software is provided “AS IS”, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including reliability, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>7. Limitation of Liability</strong><br>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or consequences arising from the use or inability to use this software, including but not limited to data loss, accidental wipes, or security failures.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>8. Acceptance</strong><br>
        By using ArgrynGuard, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted these terms.
